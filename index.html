        Hey there, I'm Yuqing, a freelance teacher working in Ed Tech.
        After studying for a Master's degree in Urban Development Planning,
        I started my journey of web development in 2022.
        <br><br>
        I code in Python, JavaScript and Ruby on Rails.
        <br><br>
        I am passionate about learning new
        things and hope to apply my technical skills to create beautiful and functional web apps.

      <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
      <button id='button2' class="toggle-button">Show/Hide</button>
      <p id="answer" class="hidden">
        My tech journey began with learning Data Science, driven by my love for Python.
        However, I quickly realised that I wanted to work on something more
        practical and enjoyable, beyond cleaning data and training models.
        <br><br>
        As a result, I delved into responsive web design through freeCodeCamp and
        completed The Odin Project's introduction track. I'm currently on track to
        finish the University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open course, bringing
        me closer to my dream of becoming a Web Developer.
        <br><br>
        But the journey into Web Development is not just about acquiring new skills.
        I'm also eager to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate with them
         on projects. After hesitating for a while, I was able to complete projects with
         the help of Founders and Coders' Wednesday meetup group for women and Non-binary people.
        <br><br>
        I'm looking forward to continuing to learn and grow with the community.
