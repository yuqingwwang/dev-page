# about-me

A [website](https://yuqingwwang.github.io/about-me/) showcasing my application.

- About me
- Why I wish to move into a career as a web developer
- Showcase what Iâ€™ve learnt so far

# Thought Process
Step 1: breaking down the page into three sections: Intro, Question and Project Gallery

Step 2: filling each section with texts and link to github repo

Step 3: adding hide/show button for each section

Step 4: added links to Github and Linkedin at the top

Step 5: added slideshow showcasing three of my favourite projects

This is fo sure the most interesting project I've completed as a part of the FAC
application. I have also deployed this page to my [personal website](https://www.yuqingwang.dev/) ðŸŽ‰

# Learning from others
Seeing a page made by a previous student inspired my to add a Slideshow to my page.
I followed the tutorial on W3schools, and made a Slideshow of my top projects.
