# about-me

A [website](https://yuqingwwang.github.io/about-me/) showcasing my application.

- About me
- Why I wish to move into a career as a web developer
- Showcase what Iâ€™ve learnt so far

# Thought Process
Step 1: breaking down the page into three sections: Intro, Question and Project Gallery

Step 2: filling each section with texts and link to github repo

Step 3: adding hide/show button for each section

Step 4: added links to Github and Linkedin


Now I'm using this page as the about me page that I share with others ðŸŽ‰

# Next Step? ðŸ¤”

Planning to display the actual previews of projects on this page instead of just a link
